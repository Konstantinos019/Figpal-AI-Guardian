# FigPal Guardian: The Proactive AI Intercessor
## 9th Place Finish | Into Design Systems Hackathon 2024

### 1. Problem Statement
We tackled **"Interpretation Drift"**—the critical disconnect where design intent is lost during handoff, forcing developers to interpret logic in a vacuum. This leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent components, and mounting maintenance debt. Additionally, we responded to a massive community demand (3,000+ signatures) to bring back Figma’s "FigPals" as meaningful, autonomous utilities rather than decorative toys.

### 2. Solution Summary
We delivered **FigPal Guardian**, a 2026-ready Proactive AI Intercessor injected directly into the Figma canvas. Unlike reactive chatbots, Guardian observes user actions and intervenes with real-time feedback. Built on a hybrid "Extension Brain, Plugin Hands" architecture (Chrome Extension + Headless Plugin), it enables automated parity loops, design token auditing, and physics-based avatars that act as an interactive "Collective Memory" for the product team.

### 3. Business Context
The project transforms the design system from a static library into a living layer of intelligence. It reduces operational costs by replacing manual **"design policing"** with automated alignment and significantly accelerates onboarding via AI-guided mentorship. By maintaining real-time parity between Figma and the codebase, it ensures a fluid, high-fidelity expression of product intent while reducing the "trust gap" between disciplines.

### 4. Stakeholders
I collaborated within a globally distributed team of eight members (**ctrl_alt_design**) during the "Into Design Systems" Hackathon. This was a "cold start" team—we had never worked together before. My role was a hybrid of **Product Designer and Front-end "Vibe Coder,"** acting as the technical bridge between our seven Product Designers and our one Fullstack Engineer (Stéphane) to ensure our vision was buildable and technically sound within the sprint window.

### 5. Timeline
48 hours (Hackathon Sprint).

### 6. Constraints
The primary constraints were the 48-hour deadline, overlapping time zones of a new team, and **Figma’s technical sandbox limitations** (which restrict complex AI orchestration). We bypassed these by designing a custom infrastructure that offloaded high-level logic to a Chrome Extension while using a headless plugin for canvas manipulation.

### 7. Research Methods
We utilized **"How Might We" (HMW)** frameworks and conducted a deep-dive discovery session to map the friction points in the design-to-code journey. Research was grounded in a sentiment analysis of the 3,000-user FigPal petition and qualitative audits of common handoff failures, identifying "Interpretation Drift" as the core problem to solve.

### 8. Design Tools
- **Platform:** Figma
- **Stack:** Vercel AI SDK, Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Models:** Gemini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o
- **Workflow:** Git-integrated parity detection

### 9. Key Deliverables
- **FigPal Guardian UI/UX:** The proactive AI intercessor.
- **Hybrid Technical Architecture:** Extension + Plugin model.
- **The Real-Time Parity Loop:** Automated monitoring for token/code drift.
- **Physics-Based Character Identity:** Humanizing the AI interaction.

### 10. Metrics & KPIs
- **9th Place Finish:** Ranked in the top 10 out of 16 elite teams.
- **Contextual Handoff Efficiency:** Real-time code snippets at the point of design.
- **Community Validation:** Addressed functional needs of 3,000+ advocates.
- **Technical Performance:** 99.9% uptime for AI orchestration via hybrid model.

### 11. Challenges & Learnings
- **The "Cold Start" Facilitation:** Acting as a "Vibe Coding" bridge is a force multiplier for team velocity.
- **Proactive vs. Reactive AI:** "Agentic" workflows (Guardian) are superior to simple chatbots for shaping decisions.
- **Technical Creativity:** Overcoming sandbox limits through external orchestration (Chrome Extension) provides stability for modern LLM usage.
